<h2>The first day of a month or not</h2>
<html>

 <body>
  <p>We are used to talking about days in relation to their position in a month, for example, February 22. But as we've already mentioned, there's another way to address a day: to give an order number to each day in a year. Then we could say, for example, "53rd day of the year". </p> 
  <p>Write a program that reads a year and the order number of a day, and checks if this day is the first day of a month or not.</p> 
  <p>The program must output either "<strong>true"</strong> or "<strong>false"</strong>.</p>
