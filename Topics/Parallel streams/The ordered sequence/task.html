   You'd like to sort the list of numbers using a stream.
  <p></p> 
  <pre><code class="language-java">List&lt;Integer&gt; numbers = List.of(3, 5, 4, 8, 9, 2);</code></pre> 
  <p>Which of the following pipeline(s) will print the numbers in the sorted order?</p> 
  <p>It will be good if you not just find the answer, but also understand why this is so.</p>
