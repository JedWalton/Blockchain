<h2>Visualization of state</h2>
<html>
 <head></head>
 <body>
   This time your team decided to make a prototype of an algorithm visualization application. For starters, your teammates created a class called 
  <code class="java">SelectionSort</code> to run a selection sort algorithm and a class called 
  <code class="java">AlgorithmVisualizer</code> to control the algorithm execution step by step both forward and backward. All visualization logic is finalized but one required class and some methods in 
  <code class="java">SelectionSort</code> have not been implemented yet, and this will be your task.
  <p></p> 
  <p>Look carefully at the <code class="java">SelectionSort</code> class and decide which fields represent its state, then implement the <code class="java">SelectionSort.SortState</code> class to store snapshots of the <code class="java">SelectionSort</code> state, and after that implement the <code class="java">getState</code> and <code class="java">setState</code> methods in <code class="java">SelectionSort</code> to actually save and restore its state. That's it!</p>
