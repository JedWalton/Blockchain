 <body>
  <p>You need to implement the <code class="java">generateNCats</code> method to generate <code class="java">n</code> identical cats. We are not kidding, we need exactly the same cats. You may ask why this might be useful, but this is a quite common situation when writing unit tests when you need objects with any values of their fields. This problem will be especially useful if you apply your knowledge of method / constructor references here.</p>
