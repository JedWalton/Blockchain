 <body>
  <p>You need to implement a method that returns a prepared stream for detecting bad words. The method has two parameters:</p> 
  <ul> 
   <li>a text in which all words are divided by single whitespaces;</li> 
   <li>a list all possible bad words.</li> 
  </ul> 
  <p>The method must return a stream of all unique bad words present in the text, in lexicographical order (like in a disctionary).</p>
